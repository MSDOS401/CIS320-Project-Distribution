Found the project to be descriptive but was unable to run the code fully.
The data used and goals of the project were there and understandable and interesting. 
Data was successfully divided and summarized but if the graphs were there it would of been awesome as well!
But I understand some graphs were unable to be generated as I had the same issue with my project.
